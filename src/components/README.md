# Components

Shared UI components used across the application.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (header, footer, sidebar, etc.)

## Guidelines

- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for all props
- Export components from index files for clean imports
- Follow naming convention: PascalCase for component files
